  <!-- Unique -->
  <div class="container section">
    <div class="custom-card">
      <h4 class="blue-text text-darken-2">Unique</h4>
      <p>The designs I create stretch imagination and allow me to come up with unique ideas and learning paths. Although some of the designs currently may seem like they aren't as unique, they allow for uniqueness due to the sole fact that they were created using just my pure imagination.</p>

    <div class="custom-card" style="margin: 0 22rem;">
      <h4 class="teal-text text-darken-2">Creative</h3>
      <p>I tend to think outside the box a lot of the time and that allows me to gain a better grasp of what my strengths and weaknesses are. Whenever I try to create something, I tend to always rough sketch something first then rework it to bring it more to life.</p>

  <!-- Problem Solver -->
  <div class="container section">
    <div class="custom-card">
      <h4 class="purple-text text-darken-2">Problem Solver</h4>
      <p>I tend to run into a lot of problems when creating 3D and 2D games. It is a hastle at times, but I truly enjoy it a lot because I am able to think of solutions I didn't think were posible and apply it to the situation to make it work. I have dedication and motivation in order to solve the problems I need to work on.</p>
